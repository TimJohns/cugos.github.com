**Brendan Farrell** of **[Clockwork Micro](https://www.clockworkmicro.com/)** will share observations from his year working in GIS in Paris. He'll discuss open data, the IGN (French equivalent of the USGS) and one of his favorites: Le Salon International de l'Agriculture.

**[Karsten Vennemann](www.terragis.net)** will showcase a [web-based Land Evaluation Tool](http://declare.terragis.net) designed to assess land suitability for cultivating crops such as maize, cassava, and cotton in Northern Benin and Northern Ghana. This tool is an integral component of the [DeClaRe project](https://www.uni-kassel.de/forschung/declare/home) ("Decision Support for Strengthening Land Resilience in the Face of Global Challenges"). DeClaRe is an interdisciplinary agricultural science initiative, and this tool contributes to a broader decision support system (DSS) aimed at enhancing land use, management, and policy development.

**Anyone** is invited to share (their own or news about any interesting) small or large geospatial projects. As always any geo-questions are encouraged and will gladly be discussed within the group.
