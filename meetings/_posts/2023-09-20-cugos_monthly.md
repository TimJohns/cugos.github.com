**Keenan Ganz** will talk about **thermal modeling with LiDAR** data from NSF NEON. Keenan is a PhD student in the Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis Laboratory at UW. He studies canopy temperature in conifer forests at multiple scales: in situ thermometers, drone thermography, and satellite imagery. Keenan is interested in developing software to refine canopy temperature measurements, and in using these data to monitor forest health.

Qingyue Li will present a data visualization and mapping project she is currently working on, entitled "Carbs on the Coast.

**Karsten Vennemann** will share some notes on efficiently obtaining and consolidating US Census bloc and bloc group data (including disaggregated US election results from 2016,2018 and 2020).

**We** will have a dicussion about coming up with new topics for our meetings in October and November.

**Anyone** is invited to share (their own or news about any interesting) small or large geospatial projects. As always any geo-questions are encouraged and will gladly be discussed within the group.
